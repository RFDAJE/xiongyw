X11 forwarding using ssh client on windows 


- install XMING as the x server, which by default listening on port 6000 (aka, the ":0.0" display)
- ssh -R 6010:localhost:6000 user@server
  once log in, set DISPLAY environment first by: export DISPLAY=:10
  the run the x apps.

  notice that the port number 6000 and 6010 and the "display" part of [host]:<display>[.screen]

  e.g.:


C:\Users\ywxiong>ssh -R 6010:localhost:6000 bruin@10.12.2.174
bruin@10.12.2.174's password:
Linux d7 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.2.54-2 x86_64

- Don't know why -X does not work? seems once login, no new listening port is created on the ssh server...
- Question: how to execute the "export DISPLAY=:10.0" togehter with the ssh command, without disconnecting? how Putty GUI does this?
