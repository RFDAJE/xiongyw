- expect abstract itself above various interactive programs (which may communicate with serial ports in different ways)
- everything (file, process, pipe) is treated as a file, represented as either a fd (int) or a stream (FILE*)
- expect communicates with its spawned processes via pty (opened/duped as fd and converted to streams)
- "expect" is fread() or read() or similar
- "send" is fprintf() or write() or similar
- "spawn" is fork() + pty + exec()
- system vs exec: "exec cp -a * /tmp" does not work but "system..." works, as system uses shell while exec does not, for handling the glob wildcard '*' here.
