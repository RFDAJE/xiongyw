===================================
question part:

- search: change case-sensitive
- search: match whole word or not
- search within the file: search the focused item, then "persistently"
  highlight all in the file or function, dismiss the highlight; move back and forth
- jump to a specific line
- brace match (visual display, and jump back and forth)
- reference searches in project: list all occurance in the project (like SourceInsight)
