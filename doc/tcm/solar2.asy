 * The Sun seems to move against the background stars as seen from the
 * orbiting Earth. The ecliptic is the path the Sun appears to trace
 * through the stars. The Earth completes its orbit and the Sun traces
 * its entire path in a little over 365 days.

 * The celestial sphere, as in astronomy and navigation, is an imaginary
 * sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with a particular
 * celestial body (e.g. the Earth). All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of
 * as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if
 * it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The
 * celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy,
 * allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when
 * their distances are unknown or unimportant.
 *  
 * Because astronomical objects are at such remote distances, casual
 * observation of the sky offers no information on the actual
 * distances. All objects seem equally far away, as if fixed to the
 * inside of a sphere of large but unknown radius, which rotates from
 * east to west overhead while underfoot, the celestial body seems to
 * stand still. For purposes of spherical astronomy, which is concerned
 * only with the directions to objects, it makes no difference whether
 * this is actually the case, or if it is the celestial body which
 * rotates while the celestial sphere stands still.
 * 
 * The ecliptic is the apparent path of the Sun on the celestial
 * sphere, and is the basis for the ecliptic coordinate system. It
 * also refers to the plane of this path, which is coplanar with both
 * the orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the apparent orbit of the
 * Sun around the Earth. The path of the Sun is not normally
 * noticeable from the Earth's surface because the Earth rotates,
 * carrying the observer through the cycle of sunrise and sunset,
 * obscuring the apparent motion of the Sun with respect to the stars.
 *
 * As the Earth takes one year to make a complete revolution around
 * the Sun, the apparent position of the Sun also takes the same length
 * of time to make a complete circuit of the ecliptic. With slightly more
 * than 365 days in one year, the Sun moves a little less than 1° 
 * "eastward" every day.  The directions north and south on the
 * celestial sphere are in the sense toward the north celestial pole and
 * toward the south celestial pole. East is the direction toward which
 * the Earth rotates, west is opposite that.
 *
 * The small difference in the Sun's position against the stars causes
 * any particular spot on the Earth's surface to catch up with (and
 * stand directly north or south of) the Sun about 4 minutes later each
 * day than it would if the Earth did not orbit; our day is 24 hours
 * long rather than the approximately 23-hour 56-minute sidereal
 * day. Again, this is a simplification, based on a hypothetical Earth
 * that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with
 * which the Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so
 * the speed with which the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also
 * varies.

 * Obliquity of the ecliptic is a name used by astronomers for the 
 * inclination of Earth's equator to the ecliptic, or of Earth's 
 * rotation axis to a perpendicular to the ecliptic. It is about 23.4° 
 * and is currently decreasing 0.013 degrees per hundred years due 
 * to planetary perturbations.
 *
 * As the rotational axis of the Earth is not perpendicular to its
 * orbital plane, the Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the
 * ecliptic plane, but is inclined to it by an angle of about 23.4°,
 * which is known as the obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is
 * projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial
 * equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the
 * equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses
 * the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the
 * other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is
 * known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries
 * and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator.
 * The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending
 * node.
