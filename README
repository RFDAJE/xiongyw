1. install git

- Linux 
  "yum install git"
  "pacman -S git"
  "apt-get install git"

- Windows: 

  install "Git-1.7.11-preview20120620.exe";
  Set the "PATH" environment variable, by putting "C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin" in the *front* of the list. This is to ensure we use the right "find.exe", not the one comes with Windows. To do so, go the steps similar to the following: Control Panel->System->Advanced settings->Environment Variable...
  

2. Clone the depot:

- goto a directory desired
- do: git clone https://xiongyw@github.com/xiongyw/xiongyw.git
